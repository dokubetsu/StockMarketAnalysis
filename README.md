This project aims to predict stock prices using historical data, technical indicators, and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models. It utilizes Streamlit for the interactive web application and integrates various features such as Moving Averages (SMA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), with plans to include more like Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and other techincal indicators.

This project is currently in development. 

More features and improvements are planned, including:

Incorporation of MACD indicator for enhanced technical analysis.
Fine-tuning of LSTM models for better prediction accuracy.
Enhancements to the user interface and interactive features.
